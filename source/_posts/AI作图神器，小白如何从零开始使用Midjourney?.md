## How do I use midjourney?
First of all, you need to have a [Discord](https://discord.com/) login, because Midjourney runs entirely on Discord. If you haven't signed up for Discord yet, don't worry, it's free.

Visit the official [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F) website, click Join Beta, and you will automatically receive a Discord invite.

Accept the Midjourney invitation in Discord, after that your Discord interface will not open automatically, don't worry. Find a Midjourney icon that looks like a boat in the left menu and click on it.

Once you're in the Midjourney app, look for a newbie room in the Midway channel. There are usually many newbie rooms to choose from, with names like "xiaobai-054". You can choose any one of them to start your creative journey.

Are you ready to start creating art in AI? Just a note, as part of the free trial, you can only use a certain number of prompt options. You'll be able to create about 25 free images, and after that, if you want to continue, you'll have to purchase a full membership. If you don't want to spend the money, it's best to spend some time ahead of time conceptualizing what you want to create.

When you're ready, type "/imagine" into the Discord chat in the starting room. It will create a prompt field where you can enter a description of the image you want the AI to create. The more detailed your description, the better the results the AI will create. If you have a specific style requirement, remember to mention it in the description.

When you're done, press Enter to send your instructions. Give Midjourney a minute to generate the image. Usually the AI will create several different versions based on your description.

Look underneath the generated image and you'll see the U and V buttons and the number markers 1 through 4. These numbers correspond to the four images Midjourney generates for you. Clicking U upgrades the image you've selected to a larger, sharper version; while V creates a completely new piece of artwork based on the current image you've selected. There's also a Refresh button, and clicking it will regenerate a new set of images for you to choose from. Remember that each action consumes some of your free hints, so only proceed when you're sure you want to continue.

If you find an image you like and select U to enlarge it, you'll get a new set of options. You can choose to reprocess the image, zoom in to the maximum size or if you don't feel happy with it, redo the image with a slight zoom and so on.

Once you've finished your creation, you can private message your work directly to yourself by selecting the envelope emoticon and adding it to the chat. This allows you to save and download your creations whenever you want.

If you plan on using Midjourney frequently, you can type "/subscribe" into any bot channel in Midjourney's Discord. This will create a link that you can simply click on to complete the subscription payment.

For those of you who plan on using Midjourney for the long term, you can also check out the manual for a list of additional commands and advice on how to create images.

## What are the advantages and disadvantages of midjourney?

### Midjourney has the following advantages:

Explore dream destinations: Midjourney maps out the best adventures for travelers with its wealth of travel information and personalized recommendation features.

Create a unique travel experience: Midjourney's intelligent recommendations are based on the traveler's personal tastes and historical itinerary to create a one-of-a-kind travel experience.

Real-time information updates: Midjourney refreshes your travel information in real-time, ensuring you have the most up-to-date and accurate travel information.

Artist's secret: Midjourney incorporates the unique insights of a team of artists in the training process of the model, presenting you with a unique aesthetic perspective.

Diversified style presentation: Midjourney has a rich stylized language that accurately expresses a variety of visual styles, demonstrating its exquisite professional ability.

Efficient and stress-free creation: Midjourney has a very low dependence on input when generating images, and can quickly achieve a high degree of completion, making your creative journey easier and more enjoyable.

### Midjourney also has some disadvantages:

Dance of text and images: Midjourney is like a dancer trying to master the dance of text and images at the same time, but struggling. Its text and image generation do not come from the same model structure, which is like two dancers on the stage have difficulty in synchronizing their steps, making the audience a bit confused.

East meets West: Midjourney's presentation of cross-cultural content is like a child learning a new language - most of its training data comes from the Western world, which is like a child who only speaks English and is suddenly asked to speak French, which is naturally a bit of a struggle. For example, when generating images of Chinese food, its performance may be inferior to that of Western food, as if a gourmet is faced with an unknown delicacy and is unable to fully express its deliciousness.

Stereotype Trap: Midjourney sometimes falls into the stereotype trap when describing cross-cultural content. It's like a child who only draws "dolls" with big eyes and high noses, but when he meets a real Oriental character, he may feel lost.

Midjourney's generative graphics are like a poem, always striking when first presented, but it's a lot harder to modify them. The more you modify it, the less finished it becomes, and the elements blend together like poking holes in cardboard. So, if this happens, regenerating one might be a better option.
