Adobe Sensei is a handy assistant for designers. It simplifies tedious tasks so you can focus on your design work and increase efficiency.

## Deep Learning Analytics

What most deep learning tools have in common is that they eliminate the tedious part of the design process and can accelerate different combinations during prototyping and testing. These tools, while functional, can't tell what designs are valid and correct choices, even if the designs that look good are all good. Designers still need to sift through the results of deep learning during the design process.

The situation we currently face is similar to that of the publishing industry 33 years ago. Similar to the time when computers and typesetting technology were rapidly evolving. Digital typesetting technology is beginning to phase out traditional movable type printing technology.

## While deep learning hasn't reached perfection yet, it's clear to see that change is occurring.

Monotonous and cumbersome methods of graphic design and traditional magazine typesetting, the impact of new technology and new tools, facing extinction, only to put it digital printing technology designers, fonts can not change seconds of the movable type back and forth transport also no longer have a devastating impact, adjust the configuration and editing the design in front of the computer can be a quick solution to the matter.

Tools reduce the time consumption in the design process, and even eliminate some of the physical wear and tear that originally existed. More flexible tools provide more freedom in the creative process, but one still needs to follow design principles and specifications to compute the right results.
The same is true for deep learning.

Now let's talk about a fascinating topic - how to design with artificial intelligence. While this may seem like a new and challenging area, the topic has been raised over and over again, yet it still faces many challenges. These challenges come not only from the limitations of the technology, but also from users' and designers' quest for higher standards and faster speeds.

Imagine what it would be like if you could make computers learn new things like people do, or design tools understand and respond to your every need like people do. With the passage of time and the advancement of technology, this vision is getting closer to reality. Users' expectations of this technology will also rise, and they will want to see smarter, more refined and even sometimes amazing designs.

Look at the tech giants in recent years, such as Apple and Google, who have begun to incorporate image and video editing features as well as AI-assisted features in their mobile devices. The goal of all these features is to fulfill consumers' pursuit of a smarter, more convenient and efficient product experience. It is foreseeable that as technology continues to evolve, automation and intelligence will become the basic functions that many consumers believe products should have.

However, this also brings new challenges. The design of products and experiences will become more dynamic, and designers will need to adapt their design tools, workflows and even design thinking to cope with this change. Non-responsive design can no longer meet the needs of users, and designers will need to define problems and design softer, more compatible products based on real, dynamic data.

So, does this mean that designers need to find new ways of working? The answer is yes. Faster, smarter tools will allow designers to focus more on the user and the product itself. While design seems to be getting easier, creating great ideas and making all their elements and functions work perfectly is still a complex and difficult task.

So how should we as designers respond to the future? First and foremost, designers need to understand and grasp the relationship between technology and design, and how they connect and work with humans. This will be your foundation for the future. Secondly, as a designer you must be able to identify problems and solve them to rationalize the whole system.

So, can AI replace the role of the designer? This question is not one that concerns you or me. Designers don't need to look for a new job (unless your job is merely clerical or mechanical). Instead, designers need to start digging deeper and thinking about the entire system and rules in order to better utilize the new world of automated systems and deep learning technologies.

## So how should AI designers be able to maximize their talents? They can do so in several ways:

Become proficient in AI design tools such as Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, and so on. In addition, they need to understand various algorithms and models, such as GAN, AutoEncoder, etc., in order to generate higher-quality images and diverse ideas.

Enhance data processing skills.AI designers need to have certain data processing skills, such as data cleaning, data preprocessing, etc., in order to provide more accurate and efficient data input for model training.

Enhance creative thinking ability: AI designers need to continuously expand their creative thinking ability to provide more inspiration for generating more creative and diversified design solutions.

Cultivate aesthetic ability: AI designers need to have certain aesthetic ability in order to provide more inspiration for generating more beautiful and personalized design solutions. You can improve your aesthetic ability by appreciating excellent works and paying attention to fashion trends.

Continuously learn and explore new technologies and trends in order to improve your design level and ability. You can maintain your competitiveness by attending trainings, reading specialized books, and paying attention to industry trends.

Overall, AI designers need to keep learning and improving their skills and qualities in order to better utilize their talents and values. In the face of the future, designers need to embrace change, keep pace with the times, and continue to explore and innovate to meet the growing needs and expectations of users.
