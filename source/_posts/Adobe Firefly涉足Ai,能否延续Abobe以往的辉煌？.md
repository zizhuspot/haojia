At the beginning of the year, [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/) company announced that its products to join the AI function, adobe company believe that we are all familiar with the company, its photoshop, after effect and other well-known software development company, this time these products to join the ai function, can rub what kind of spark? Let us wait and see.

Currently hot ai products such as chatgpt, stable diffusion, midjourney have been financed to a great capital, adobe as one of the originators of the design industry, certainly will not stand idly by, because of the rich and powerful adobe company just acquired figma, so it is unlikely to continue to acquire midjourney. The company is not likely to continue to acquire midjourney because adobe has just acquired figma.

Foreign products are beginning to pile up updates and release of new content, such as Baidu's Wenxin Yiyin, midjourney v5 engine, adobe homeopathic release of Firework, obviously there is a feeling of competition white-hot.

Adobe's division of the AIGC and Sensei's senior vice president Alexandru Costin said in an interview: "We are not afraid of change, are embracing this change."

## Adobe Firefly feature profile

If you take a closer look at today's Firefly-generated products, you'll see that the quality of today's Adobe AI-generated content hasn't yet distanced itself from the current mainstream of Midjourney and Stable Diffusion.

However, Adobe's background as a dominant player in the design world cannot be overemphasized. Adobe as the industry and even the world's most famous design tools service provider, in the development of tools does have a unique first-mover advantage.

Adobe Firefly is still in beta. After receiving an invitation, you will be able to use this service on the web. Currently, Firefly has 2 basic functions, one of which is "Text to Image", which is similar to Midjourney. Enter the prompt to generate the corresponding image:

However, unlike Midjourney, Adobe offers more options and features in the right sidebar. Users have more precise control over the image scale, content features, styles, color styles, tones, and lighting attributes of the generated content. These detailed controls allow designers to get more detailed dimensions in addition to the prompt text commands.

Another tool is Text Effects, which is based on fonts. Adobe has digested the acquisition of the font service Typekit and converted it into its own Adobe Fonts service. Therefore, in the Text Effces service, Adobe directly provides fonts as the basis. Users can directly in the right sidebar to select the fonts they want to use, and then in the bottom of the page in the prompt input field to write the effect you want to generate, and then control the font layout, color scheme, style and generate the effect details.

There is also a feature coming soon called "Recolor Vector" that will generate different variations of your design based on your prompts. Details of this feature will not be available until it goes live. Compared to Stable Diffusion and Midway, the effects currently available in Firefly are a slight step forward in terms of detailed functionality, but they don't close the gap.

It's worth noting that the features offered by Adobe Firefly are quite different from the points made in the introductory video.

## How will Firefly integrate with Adobe Family Bucket?

The head honchos Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are still busy iterating their algorithmic engines. Even a big company like Adobe doesn't have the means to embed Firefly directly into the Adobe Family Bucket for a limited time, these features are complex and large.

Adobe reportedly plans to gradually integrate Firefly's features into existing FamilyMart members. For example, cue words can be used to generate materials in Photoshop. For example, hand-drawn content in Adobe Illustrator will be able to generate different variations with the support of artificial intelligence. , you can also use the cues in Pr to directly adjust the color effect of a specific image.

Combined with the demo available on Adobe's website, we can get a glimpse of the future of design:

Use the prompt command prompt to "create" design material out of thin air, directly into the visual content, and quickly execute ideas. Generate custom vector files, brushes and texture patterns from existing simple sketches for in-depth editing. Use prompts to modify the visual content of video content, or even completely change the weather effects of a scene.

You can even upload entire moodboard materials and use the prompt commands to generate original, ready-to-use graphics and text layouts for social media. This content can be accurately matched to banners, posters, and other material forms.

Even more imaginative is the future of 3D design. With Firefly's support, realistic 3D graphics can be generated directly, and variants and materials for 3D content can be generated quickly.

Comparing these demos, there's a lot of room for imagination, but Adobe has yet to reveal a specific timeline for upgrading these features. Google and Baidu are currently in a similar stage, making plans before implementing them, so we'll see what happens.

## What is Adobe's attitude towards AI?

Adobe wants to develop AI while also siding with creators and reducing the resistance of creative workers to AI creation.

Adobe is also one of the few platforms that is really exploring sources of input for AI training. According to Adobe's current disclosure, the training data used by Adobe mainly comes from content that has passed the copyright protection period, or content that has been licensed for training and exists in the Adobe Stock library. This licensed, Adobe-owned content gives Adobe, as the core of the creative industry, the confidence to use AIGC technology to face the scrutiny of their peers in the art and design industry.

We're designing generative AI so that creators can benefit from their skills and creativity," Kostin said in an interview.
Adobe also plans to pay artists who contribute training data. The exact compensation plan will be announced before the beta version officially ends.

On the other hand, Adobe is working on a protocol called "Do Not Train". Designers and artists will be able to embed a statement of refusal to use their work as training data in the metadata of their work. For now, however, the agreement remains unilateral for Adobe. The program has not yet received feedback from other AIGC service providers.

## Summary:

Adobe's inclusion was inevitable, but Adobe Firefly is still in its early stages. Designers who want to use the Adobe family bucket like in the promotional video may have to wait a long time. We still need to continue to see how Adobe's products (and other AIGC services) protect creators' rights.
