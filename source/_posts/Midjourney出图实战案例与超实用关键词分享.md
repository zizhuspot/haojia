I'm sure you are no longer unfamiliar with the amazing tool Midjourney, but did you know? Not only is it widely used in creating posters, running banners, IPs, and other images, but it also has endless possibilities in the UI design workflow. Recently, I dug deeper into this topic and realized that Midjourney's backgrounds and icons are ripe for application in our workflow.

During this adventure, which was full of surprises, I delved into Midjourney's features, from fine filter effects to chic icon designs. I even tried to use it to create some highly creative UI elements. After a series of attempts and explorations, I found that Midjourney can not only easily create stunning images, but also help us quickly realize complex UI designs.

Of course, I encountered a lot of challenges in the process of exploration, but every time I successfully solved a problem, I felt immense satisfaction and joy. In the process, I also gained a lot of valuable experience. Now, I would like to share all of this with you, and hope that my experience will inspire you to explore more possibilities of Midjourney!

## I. The Midjourney Foundation Model

Midjourney is divided into many modes, such as V4\V5\V5.1\niji4\niji5 and so on.

- V4: generalized mode, applicable to all styles of industry, but the output of the quality and detail of the figure is not good

- V5: realistic mode, the output of the figure more style, more detail, style bias realistic

- V5.1: the recent model, in v5 based on the output of the figure more rich in detail

- niji4/5: the output of the map is basically the secondary style, of course, plus some special words can also produce 3D map

## Second, Midjourney way out of the map

Midjourney this amazing tool has two modes: produce and feed diagrams, let me in the workflow like a fish out of water, show off. Now, I will unveil the mystery of these two modes for you, and take you to enjoy their unique charm!

First, let's take a look at Raw Chart. As the name suggests, Raw Image is to input keywords into Midjourney like throwing them into the magical world, and then wait for the wonderful image to be born. While this is a fast way to produce images, the results often look like a bunch of random collages that struggle to live up to our expectations. Like the B-side icon example on the left, the structure and colors are chaotic, like a half-baked product.

Feeding images, on the other hand, is a more refined and personalized way to produce images. By feeding an existing image to Midjourney, you can get a clean and tidy icon. Take a look at the icon on the right, isn't it more polished than the raw image?

Overall, Midjourney's raw and fed images have their own characteristics. Raw charts are good for quick charts, while fed charts are better suited for situations where you have strict requirements on details. In the actual workflow, you can choose the right way of charting according to your needs. Believe me, after some exploration and experimentation, you will have a new understanding of Midjourney's techniques!

## III. Commonly used directives/suffixes

- **Commonly used commands: **

/imagine Requests to draw a diagram

/describe for feeding diagrams to extract keywords

/settings Setting parameters

- **Common suffixes: ** --s 700

--s 700 Higher values deviate from the description.

--q 2.5 The smaller the value, the faster the drawing and the less detail.

-- iw 1 The higher the value, the more it deviates from the picture you're feeding.

--ar 16:9 control ratio

:: geed 4.5 image weights, so the resulting image focuses on which keywords

--no geed Add what won't appear

## 4. Pre-setup

## midjourney strengths and weaknesses analysis

Midjourney has three highlights and two points to be improved:

First of all, Midjourney's "super power" should not be underestimated. It is like a powerful actor, combining voice assistant, calendar reminder, real-time weather broadcasting and news information and other functions. With it, users can easily complete a variety of tasks, saving time and greatly improving work efficiency.

Midjourney is like a master of art in modeling, and it can be used to get various styles of pictures. Of course, Midjourney is also a particularly chatty assistant, with simple prompts for satisfying images and stylized words.

However, Midjourney has two minor shortcomings. The first is the initial setup. Despite Midjourney's rich feature set, users may need to make some adjustments in language preferences, personal information, and more during initial setup. For some techies, this may cause some trouble.

Another point is the accuracy of the voice recognition, Midjourney's voice recognition is commendable, but it may not be accurate when dealing with people who have a particular accent or speak at a fast pace. This may affect the users' experience of receiving and using the commands.

Overall, Midjourney is like an assistant with 18 skills, powerful and aesthetic. Although there are some small challenges, we believe that it will bring more surprises to users in the future optimization!

## V. Practice Tips
