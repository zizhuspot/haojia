ai production works although the visual effect is very good, but it is very easy to appear anyone will encounter the problem: the brain envisioned the effect and the ai production effect will often be very different, although repeated many times, but still can not get the desired effect.

It is easy to convince the user by using longer descriptions. So how can you explain as little as possible and let the AI know what you want? In this article, we'll give you 6 of the most effective tips for midjourney out of the picture!

It is easy to convince the user by using longer descriptions. So how can you explain as little as possible and let the AI know what you want? In this article, we'll give you the 6 most effective tips for midjourney out of the picture!

## tip 1 - Use affirmative commands, not vague ones

midjourney doesn't understand negative descriptors very well right now, so don't use negatives like not, but, except, without, etc.
This is because if a word is mentioned in the word, ai will most likely ignore the logic of the negation to draw a picture.

For example, if you want to create a picture of a cat, avoid "not black cat" and use "pink cat".
![](https://s2.loli.net/2023/07/27/o6WyzEN8nTxFPd9.png)

For example, if you want to create a cat that looks like a rabbit, it is more accurate to use (**a rabbit like-cat**) than (a cat but looks like a rabbit).

## tip 2-use concrete descriptors instead of abstract ones

When we try to describe an image in words, abstract descriptors tend to make the picture blurry and even more than we expect, making it difficult to control accurately. Therefore, we need to use concrete descriptions whenever possible in order to convey our ideas more accurately.

Let's look at an example. If we want to generate an image of a cat in a meeting, we probably don't want a situation where humans are in the room and there is only one cat. Therefore, instead of using an abstract description like "cat in meeting", we can use the more concrete "3 cats chatting" instead. In this way, the generated image will be a group of cats in a meeting instead of a human with one cat in the meeting room.

Therefore, we should try to avoid using abstract descriptors such as expectation, dream, utility, concept, meaning, imagination, experience, memory, argument, narrative, etc. Instead, we should use more concrete descriptors. Instead, we should use more concrete descriptions to express our ideas to help us control the generated pictures more accurately.

## tip 3- Too much detail can make Midjourney more confusing

Ai doesn't always understand the relationship between descriptions, and more descriptions and wordings may confuse Ai about what you mean, resulting in a less-than-perfect quality image.

For example, if you want to generate a group of dancing cats, it would be better to use (**3 black cats in tutus dancing on the top floor**) than (3 black cats in tutus dance around the altar on the top floor of a sun-baked building). to pray for rain) would come out better.

## Tip 4- Use specific quantities instead of indeterminate quantities

As stated above, concrete is greater than vague/abstract, and concrete numbers are greater than (many/few/much...) .

(8 cats playing together) > (many cats)

## tip 5- Avoid using words that make people delve into fantasies

You need to check whether the descriptors you write will make people delve into fantasies. Because Midjourney will produce images no matter what keywords you enter, but the images produced may be far from what you want, so avoid using words that make you fantasize.

For example (Alien Cultures in the Multiverse) <(**Sci-fi Alien Workstation**)

## Additional tips for use

There are many ways to use Midjourney, and there are also these tips below to help you:

Settings commands: You can type in the "settings" command to bring up the settings, selecting the type of model, different quality details, rendering speed, etc.

Mixing and adjusting: In the "remix mode" you can generate images and choose the one you are most satisfied with to generate a high quality version. The "make variations" button will appear below the image, click on it to generate different versions of the image for basic additional operations.

Chaos parameter: Use the "chaos" parameter to give the AI more of your own ideas.

Cue weights: You can add " ::+ value" for different cues and the system will adjust the weight of this cue according to the value.

Negative parameter: add "--no+content" to remove elements you don't want to appear in the image.

Fixed settings: You can use the "prefer suffix" command to set the aspect ratio, rendering quality and other parameters, so that in the subsequent generation of images, these basic settings will be automatically added.

Use of seed parameters: By using the "seed" parameter, you can generate a series of images with similar composition, color and details.

Image weight: The "iw" parameter can adjust the similarity between the generated image and the reference image, the value range is 0.5-2, the larger the value the closer to the original image.

Midjourney also has many advanced features, such as 3D generation, multi-picture compositing, etc. For specific operations, you can check the official Midjourney tips or related tutorials.

The key to unlocking the magic world of Midjourney is its ability to make your ideas dance on the canvas. And when you master another secret - the skillful use of translation software - your level of creativity will rise like the wind and the waves. In the end, I wish every creator could harness the power of AI and turn their unlimited creativity into amazing works.
