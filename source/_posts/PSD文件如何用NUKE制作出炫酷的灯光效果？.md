The magical world of NUKE goes beyond just importing models; it recognizes a variety of file formats such as abc, fbx, obj, etc., allowing us to easily bring our designs into 3D space. But imagine if we could continue this visual feast without these preset models? The answer is yes! Let's reveal this wonderful secret: how does NUKE achieve 3D lighting simulation effects with only psd drawings provided by the art? It's like looking for endless possibilities out of nothing!

## 1. Build the environment

**STEP 1**

Build the nuke 3D space base node "Camera, Scene, ScanlineRender".

**STEP 2**

Create a new sphere model "Sphere", paste the psd into the sphere, and add Project3D in the middle to link to the scene; in order to facilitate the subsequent adjustment of lighting, you need to add "TransformGeo" below the sphere model, and adjust the spatial position of the sphere to make it push and pull the sphere. Adjust the spatial position of the sphere to push it farther away.

The effect is as shown in the picture, so that out of the figure and the original psd figure is consistent, you can carry out the second step to increase the lighting animation

## 2. Increase lighting animation

**STEP 1**

Add the light "Light" to the "scene" scene; as shown:

Add the light "Light" to the "scene", as shown in the following picture: ! [](https://s2.loli.net/2023/07/26/p1Gn89UtmqLOV6u.png)

**STEP 2**

Adjust the lighting animation to the position you feel is appropriate; two lights are made here, the main light and the secondary light; then set the primary and secondary according to the requirements of the screen.

## 3. Final additions

**STEP 1**

Give the model red, green and blue channels, use the "hue rotation" in the "HueShift" node to adjust the red, green and blue channel changes. As shown in the figure:

**STEP 2**

Optimize the channel; adjust "Grade", "keyer" and "blur" to make the "Alpha channel" reach the desired effect. " to achieve the desired effect;

**STEP 3**

Tone the color, use the "grade" node to highlight;

## **Summary and extended information**:

This time we will use NUKE to create a visual feast, that cool lighting effect is by no means idle. What is the secret of it? That is to skillfully adjust the color channel. This is a skill that you need to master, and you need to summarize your experience in daily work practice. Remember, only by constantly sharpening your basic skills can you stand out, go faster, and go farther in this fantastical career as a special effects artist.

- **The NUKE Advantage**

NUKE's mysterious technology and unique stunts have swept through the film and television world, becoming the right-hand man for countless programs. From the perspective of nuclear synthesis training, its visual magic is mainly displayed in the following aspects:

One, the key to facing the challenge of complex synthesized images lies in matching the right tools and mastering their characteristics. Otherwise, one may have to painstakingly cut clips to get the desired effect, and such attempts often carry the implicit risk of damaging the production process and credibility.

Second, NUKE's powerful toolkit comes with a range of powerful NUKE-like tools that can handle a variety of work challenges, including stunning visual effects and compositing systems. This was one of the major challenges of the entire job: expanding and compositing for individual scenes into specific scenes.

Third, NUKE's version control makes movie compositing a breeze, and NUKE is a powerful compositor that can handle a lot of processing with ease, while the magic of nuclear energy lies in its ability to run on multiple processors at breakneck speeds.

*Thoughtful tip*: In the combination of CG and real shooting, a small element rendered in 3D software can be layered with as many as dozens of layers, and a single shot may even contain hundreds or even hundreds of layers. It is not so convenient to deal with this kind of complex compositing in AE. NUKE's operational flowchart, on the other hand, is very clear and concise, allowing you to see at a glance what's going on in the creative process.

- **NUKE vs. AE**.

Let's explore the mysteries of After Effects (AE) and Nuke in depth:

First of all, there is a significant difference between AE and Nuke in the way they operate: *AE is based on "layers"*, just like Photoshop, where users can easily create visual effects by stacking layers on top of each other. Nuke, on the other hand, uses a node-based approach, which differs from traditional software in that each node is a small conveyor belt that passes and changes functional attributes.

Looking at the positioning of these two programs, Nuke positions itself in the high-end film and television production field, and its professionalism and complexity make it the first choice of special effects producers. AE, on the other hand, is a bit more complex. It can be used in low-end, mid-end and high-end areas, but it can be a bit overwhelming when it comes to complex file processing tasks.

*When it comes to the ability to integrate materials*, AE shows great inclusiveness. It accepts and can handle a variety of formats, including psd, ai, swf, gif, wav, etc., as if telling the world: "Come on, no matter what format, I can handle it!" In contrast, Nuke in the format support is slightly "picky", currently only supports picture sequences and mov format. But don't underestimate it's this kind of specialization, channel-based synthesis software Nuke, but the single-shot picture of ultra-high-level vfx effects synthesis of professional households, up to 1023 channel information to support the synthesis, which is it's unique skills.

The advantage of AE lies in its powerful material integration ability. Not only can all formats of material be used as material files, but it is also very suitable for dealing with multi-camera compositing of different sizes. Nuke's advantage lies in the ability to deal with three-dimensional vfx compositing better, and the highest resolution of the video processing support to reach more than 4k, which undoubtedly makes it a sharp tool in film and television production.

Overall, AE and Nuke have their own characteristics and advantages, which software to choose, the key lies in your specific needs and workflow.

## **How to improve your AE? **

To improve your Adobe After Effects (AE) skills, you can do the following:

Master the basics: To successfully navigate AE, you first need to know its basic operations like the back of your hand. From importing your first video clip to understanding and applying core features such as keyframing, masking, and tracking are essential steps. You also need to familiarize yourself with and master AE's interface, including the menus, compositing window, timeline, effects and presets panels, making them your handy tools.

Mastering advanced techniques: Once you are comfortable with the basics of AE, you can start exploring its advanced features. For example, *use 3D layers to create three-dimensional effects*, use camera tracking to achieve real-world perspective tracking, or create particle effects for visual impact. These are all powerful aspects of AE, and by learning and practicing, you can take your work to the next level.

*Enhance your design sense and creativity: AE is a truly creative and design tool, so enhancing your design and creative skills is also key to improving.
