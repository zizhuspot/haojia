The formula: **Subject element + style/type of painting/art genre = generated image**.

For example, the following will show how to generate Ai images for various styles:

**1. Step 1:**

Mode Selection **(Universal Smart SD XL 1.0)**

**2. Step 2: **.

Enter the **theme element** (e.g. a dog) + **art style** (e.g. Van Gogh) you want to generate.

The following will show the specific generated case in detail:

- ***A Dog + [Pop Art](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E6%B3%A2%E6%99%AE%E8%97%9D%E8%A1%93)****

You can add any *style*, type of painting, school of art , aka your favorite artist's name to the descriptor. *

If you can't think of something you want, you can also press the shortcut ***" / "*** to see the character words, where we've put a lot of options for reference and one-click additions.

But here, our method is only half of the show, you can select the same body elements, constantly changing the style words, to unlock more types of works; the same can also be fixed style, by changing the body elements, to complete a series of works of creation.

Take the dog sticker we just generated as an example:

1. add as *** reference map ***, set the intensity of the reference map *** [1]***

![](https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/13/W3YgmFk8cdpvCUh.png)

2. Modify the descriptor: * four tigers, stickers ***[1]*** !

![](https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/13/c8slGDtxqjdbSZr.png)

Similarly, you can follow the style of the reference image to generate a Chinese Zodiac collection like the one below, looks great, right?

## Additional Concepts:

What is [Stable Diffusion XL](https://stablediffusionxl.com/)?

Stable Diffusion XL, or SDXL for short, is the latest AI image generator! It has a realistic face generation function, and it can even render text clearly in the image, so you can take your creation to the next level. Even more surprisingly, SDXL enables image compositing with more concise prompts, allowing you to create colorful artwork with ease.

Like its predecessor, SDXL also features powerful image generators such as "Cue from Image to Image," "Inpainting (reimagining selected parts of an image)," and "Outpainting (creating new parts outside the boundaries of an image)," and more. Powerful image-generating features such as the "Image to Image Hint", "Inpainting" (reimagining selected parts of an image) and "Outpainting" (creating new parts of an image outside its boundaries) allow you to manipulate the transformation of an image as you wish.

And now, you can easily use SDXL just through DreamStudio or other image generation applications such as NightCafe Studio and ClipDrop! And don't forget that SDXL models are fully available on the HuggingFace platform, waiting for you to download them!

What are the advantages of ## stable diffusion?

The Stable Diffusion model has several advantages in image generation.

First of all, it can gradually reveal the details and shapes in an image by gradually adding and reducing noise, which makes the generated image more realistic and clear. This feature is very useful in the fields of art creation, movie effects, game development, etc., which allows creators to easily get satisfactory images and fully meet the user's requirements for perfect visual effects.

Secondly, the Stable Diffusion model can generate high-quality images, including natural landscapes, human faces, artworks, etc. It can capture the texture of the image, and it can be used to create a new image. It is able to capture the texture, shape and details of an image to generate realistic images. This feature makes it widely used in the fields of image restoration and enhancement, image denoising, etc. as well.

Third, the generation process of the Stable Diffusion model can be controlled by adjusting the diffusion parameters and the inverse process, which allows users to generate images according to their needs and preferences. This feature provides greater flexibility to the applicator.

Finally, Stable Diffusion also has good customizability. Users have the flexibility to adjust and optimize the generated images according to their needs.

Overall, the Stable Diffusion model has the advantages of high realism, high quality, high controllability, and high customizability in image generation, which makes it have a wide range of applications in the fields of art creation, movie special effects, game development, and so on.
