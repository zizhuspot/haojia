In 2023, a new generation is about to enter the workplace, the Generation Z, born after 2000, who will take over from Baby Boomers and become the mainstay of corporate employees in the next 10-20 years. Growing up with tablets, smartphones and social media, this generation has a flamboyant personality, is extremely sensitive to change and is able to hold their own in a rapidly changing environment.

For them, work is not only about making money, but also about satisfying their sense of fulfillment and needs. They are not afraid to jump from job to job as often as it takes to achieve their career goals.

However, according to a recent report by Lever, an HR software company, a whopping 65% of Gen Z professionals plan to leave their jobs within a few months, much higher than the average 40% turnover rate. Can you believe this number? That's a real shocker.

So how do you, as a business, attract great Gen Z talent? The answer is to meet their demands for working conditions. Some older people may balk at this, thinking that Gen Z is too self-absorbed. But in fact, Gen Z's view on working environment reflects the trend of contemporary society.

So let's take a look at the five work patterns preferred by Gen Z and offer suggestions on how companies can create work environments that attract Gen Z talent. These suggestions will not only help attract talented people in the long run, but also help make corporate culture more adaptable to future changes in the industrial environment, and promote the formation of workplaces with cross-generational collaboration, bringing more benefits and value to the company.
 
## Z Five Preferred Work Models for Generation Workplace Newcomers

The Generation Z crowd, who know the Internet and technology products like the back of their hand, and the fast-paced work patterns of the network era have made them a fish out of water. Their positive embrace of change, constant challenge to established frameworks and enthusiasm to fully utilize their creative potentials have resulted in a marked difference in workplace attitudes from previous generations. Below are five workstyles that they generally recognize as allowing them to perform at their best.

1. Communication-oriented workspace

Generation Z's mastery of the latest technology makes them more inclined to work from home or get rid of the traditional office environment altogether. However, the general trend of working remotely during the COVID-19 epidemic has given this generation a new appreciation for the importance of the traditional office. For them, the office is more than just a place to work; it is a space for human interaction, communication, and a place where coworkers and superiors give affirmation and feedback. Even though remote work doesn't bother them much in terms of technology and hardware, they still look forward to the opportunity to work face-to-face with their colleagues in a physical office as a way to facilitate the collision of ideas and professional growth.

2. Fill the workspace with humanized warmth
While Gen Z doesn't expect remote work to completely replace the traditional brick-and-mortar office, they also don't like the idea of being confined to one person at one desk. Privacy and flexibility are Gen Z's top concerns when planning an office space. They want to have freedom in the office and can change jobs at any time according to their needs. In recent years, the rise of the "third space" and shared office space is to meet the desire of employees for a more humanized work environment.

3. Mixing up the workplace
As part of their quest for flexibility, Gen Zers often want the freedom to choose where they work. The hybrid work model of working from home 2-3 days a week is more in line with Gen Z's desire to find a balance between working from home and working in an office, and Gen Z generally believes that having the freedom to choose their own workplace allows them to find a work pace that suits their needs, and thus achieve better work results.

4. Harmonizing work and life
Most Gen Zers can't live without their cell phones, but that doesn't mean they want to deal with work after work; Gen Z's stronger sense of self is reflected in their attitude towards their private lives. Flexible workspace and scheduling doesn't mean that work hours can be extended indefinitely; Gen Z has the ability to respond quickly to work demands, but they also need to have clear boundaries between work and private time, and enough private time to nourish the development of their personal interests.

5. Management, listen more
Good managers know how to listen to their employees' ideas and opinions, especially to Gen Z employees, who value having their opinions valued and responded to. This requires managers to adopt more diverse communication methods, not only focusing on formal communication channels, but also not neglecting informal communication methods, so that employees feel that their voices are heard and their opinions are respected.

In the age of social media, hierarchy has become flattened, and as long as one has talent, everyone has a channel to become the next KOL. such an environment has made Gen Z more bold in expressing their opinions, and hopefully, management has the ability to listen carefully. For Generation Z, age and status are no longer class differentiators. They are more interested in equal rights and want every employee in the company to have the opportunity to express his or her opinion.

## How to create a Gen Z-friendly workplace?

Based on the above five preferred work patterns of Generation Z, companies can change their existing office and operational models to create a workplace that is more in line with the needs of future generations by doing the following:

1. creating flexible workspaces

Flexible working is already an unstoppable trend for the future. Organizations can implement hybrid work models to reduce the amount of workspace required and allow employees to rotate their offices. In addition, companies can take this opportunity to re-plan the space arrangement by setting up more public workspaces according to operational needs, or setting up spaces such as brainstorming zones, rest areas, meeting areas, etc. designed according to functionality, so that employees can not only do away with a single desk, but also enjoy a space planning that is more conducive to work performance.

2. Add more humanized space design

Generation Z wants to achieve a balance between privacy and team communication in the office. The traditional space design of dozens of people sharing a cubicle-less office obviously cannot meet the demand. In response to the new office space needs, the interior design industry is also innovating and proposing many modern, private and open space designs, such as modular partition systems that can be flexibly moved according to the current needs, or niche-style semi-open personal workspaces. A new type of office space design worth considering for your business.

3. Establish a flat work structure

Generation Z places great importance on their value in the company. In order to make Gen Z employees who are currently in junior positions feel valued and willing to continuously improve their abilities and contribute to the company, companies need to establish a flatter work structure so that junior employees have more opportunities to communicate directly with senior management. With such a structure, companies can also better understand the thinking of the new generation of employees, so that the company's development can continue to follow the trend of the times.

Overall, what Generation Z seeks is not to escape the office, but to have a more flexible and humanized workspace and model. By creating this type of work environment, companies can also increase flexibility and continue to attract young creative talent.
