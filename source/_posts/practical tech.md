Code refactoring is the improvement of existing code without changing the external functionality. It is one of the core parts of programming and should not be ignored. Otherwise, you will not be able to get a better version of the code. Code refactoring enhances the readability, maintainability and scalability of the code. It also aims to improve performance and developer productivity. Today, we will explore some tips that can help you refactor your code better.

## How to Refactor

Before looking for techniques for refactoring, let's look at how to integrate code refactoring into the coding process. The following suggestions can be used for this purpose:

Allocate time specifically for refactoring code.
Break down larger refactoring issues into smaller ones to manage.
Try to involve the entire team in the refactoring process.
Use automation tools that can help you find common refactoring errors.

Now, let's start with the techniques used for refactoring.

## Technology 1: Extraction Methods

This method consists of converting blocks of code into separate methods/functions. This is done to improve the structure and readability of the code. It is achieved by extracting long and complex code blocks into smaller and more manageable methods. To use this technique, we first need to find a complex task-specific block of code. Then we extract the code from it and put it into a new method. Also, make sure to assign a meaningful name to the method.

Example:

pre-reconfiguration：
```javascript
function calculateInvoiceTotal(items) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    const item = items[i];
    if (!item.quantity || !item.price) {
      console.error('Invalid item', item);
      continue;
    }
    const itemTotal = item.quantity * item.price;
    total += itemTotal;
  }
  return total;
}
```
after reconstruction：

```javascript
function calculateInvoiceTotal(items) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
        const item = items[i];
        const itemTotal = calculateItemTotal(item);
        total += itemTotal;
    }
    return total;
}

function calculateItemTotal(item) {
    if (!item.quantity || !item.price) {
        console.error('Invalid item', item);
        return 0;
    }
    return item.quantity * item.price;
}
```

You see, we've presented the code in the loop that calculates the total price of the item as a separate function, doesn't the first function become simple and easy to read.

## Technique 2: Replacing numbers with symbolic constants

This technique is for writing cleaner and more readable code. Magic numbers are hard-coded values. Writing hard-coded numbers can cause confusion to others because their purpose is not defined. Converting hard-coded values to variables with meaningful names will definitely help others understand it. Moreover, you can add comments for further explanation. It also helps in debugging and reduces the risk of future errors.

Example:

pre-reconfiguration：
```javascript
if (temperature > 32) {
    // Do something if temperature is above freezing
}
```

after reconstruction：

```c
const int FREEZING_POINT = 32;

if (temperature > FREEZING_POINT) {
    // Do something if temperature is above freezing
}
```

## Technique 3: Merging Duplicate Codes

Duplicate or identical code may appear in code in different locations. This code does not need to be identical, but it can perform similar tasks or be further extended from the original code. Duplicate code can lead to several problems: including increased maintenance costs, difficulty in making changes to the code base, and a higher risk of introducing errors. When refactoring code, you must be aware of duplicate code. When such code is found, one way to handle it is to convert such code into a single reusable function/method.

Example:

pre-reconfiguration：

```javascript
function calculateTotal(numbers) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        total += numbers[i];
    }
    return total;
}

function calculateAverage(numbers) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        total += numbers[i];
    }
    const average = total / numbers.length;
    return average;
}
```

after reconstruction：

```javascript
function calculateSum(numbers) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        total += numbers[i];
    }
    return total;
}

function calculateTotal(numbers) {
    return calculateSum(numbers);
}

function calculateAverage(numbers) {
    const total = calculateSum(numbers);
    const average = total / numbers.length;
    return average;
}
```

In the previous code example, we summed and then averaged again. After refactoring, we replace this with a function that provides a sum for both.

## Introduction of a technology

Low code is a set of digital technology tools platform, which can realize rapid construction, data orchestration, connection ecology, and middle-ground services based on graphical drag-and-drop, parameterized configuration and other more efficient ways. It realizes scenario application innovation in digital transformation through little or no code. It can alleviate or even solve the contradiction between supply and demand triggered by the huge market demand and traditional development productivity, and is a product of the trend of cost reduction and efficiency in the process of digital transformation.

JNPF rapid development platform, which has been more prominent in recent years in terms of market performance and product competitiveness, adopts the latest mainstream front-back separation framework (SpringBoot+Mybatis-plus+Ant-Design+Vue3). The code generator has low dependency and flexible expansion capability, which can flexibly realize secondary development.

JNPF as a representative of the enterprise-level low-code platform in order to support higher technical requirements of application development , from database modeling , Web API construction to page design , and traditional software development is almost no difference , just through the low-code visualization model , reducing the construction of "add, delete, change, and check" function of the duplication of labor , have not understood the low-code partners can try to understand Low-code partners can try to understand.

With it, developers can easily get started in the development process, making full use of the experience accumulated under the traditional development mode. So the low-code platform is of great help to programmers. It is worth mentioning that JNPF provides full source code and the underlying code can be reused.
