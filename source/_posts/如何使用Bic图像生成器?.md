It is free, has no waiting list, and can be accessed without [microsoft edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge). Here's the rest of the information you need to get started with Microsoft's ai art generator.
In recent months, the use of various [artificial intelligence](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD) tools has skyrocketed, and we've seen generative AI sprout up in places where it would be completely impossible to develop.

It all started with the launch of openai's interactive AI chatbot [chatgpt](https://openai.com/chatgpt) last fall, which surprised users with its natural tone, ease of use, and utility.

## bic differs from dall-e 2 in many ways

The next two tech giants, Google and Microsoft, launched autonomous AI chatbots called "bard" and "bing chat" respectively, and these bots kicked off a wave of AI craze. However, the boom has also raised many safety, ethical and economic issues.

Microsoft has released an AI image generator on its bing search engine that utilizes a more advanced version of another openai called [dall-e 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2). To learn more about the dall-e 2 image generator, you can visit openai's official website directly. Here, you can simply enter the prompt in the text field and wait quietly for the AI to create the image for you.

While both dall-e 2 and bing image creator are capable of creating distinctive images through artificial intelligence, there are significant differences in the way they work. To give you a better understanding of the similarities and differences between these two tools, we're going to explore their features in detail and which AI tool is the leader in art creation.

First, we're going to dive into how to use the new bing image creator.

Imagine you walk into a magnificent palace surrounded by deep blue walls, as if you were in the middle of a vast ocean. The golden curtains sway gently in the breeze, glittering brightly. In the corner of the room, a lazy zebra lies leisurely, seemingly enjoying this wonderful moment. And now you can bring this wonderful scene into your world with bing image creator!

Want to try it? No need for a dall-e 2 or openai account, just open your browser, visit your microsoft account, and head to bing.com. Find ".bing.com/create" on the site, click on it, and you're ready to begin your journey of artistic creation!

### 1. Access the required image creation tools and log in

Unlike bing chat, access to bing image builder does not require microsoft edge access. [https://www.bing.com/create](https://www.bing.com/create) Click on "**join create**".

Just log in to your Microsoft account and access the image generator.

### 2. Enter the prompt

At this point, please enter a description of the image for which you want to generate a hint. Just like with an AI chatbot, please be as explicit as possible in describing whether the result is correct or not.

Enter the prompt in the text area and click "**Create**".

For this prompt, I asked for: "A picture of a swan lying in a royal parlor decorated in gold." Click on "**Create**" and wait for the picture.

### 3. Result view

As soon as the exciting picture is ready, you can see the wonderful result. It's worth noting that DALL-E 2 and Bing's image generator often show four images per posting, making for a great look.

So how does DALL-E 2, the AI wizard, turn magnificent imagery into a work of art?

Honestly, many free AI image generators are not that sophisticated, and the images they generate may not be real, and there are often small errors in details such as finger positions, eye areas, keys on the computer keyboard, and other details that are quite interesting.

You see, this picture of a swan, created by the image generator I summoned, is simply beautiful and impressive, and I'm very pleased with the result.

Next, let's move on to the crucial step - image download! After browsing through all the generated images, I decided to bookmark the one below. With a single click, you can expand the image, which then shows you a series of options to choose from: share, save to account, download, or provide feedback. It's worth noting that you can choose to download one, all, or none of the images at all, depending on your preference!

2. What is DALL-E 2?

DALL-E 2 is an AI language model developed by OpenAI that generates images from textual descriptions. It is the second version of the DALL-E model, which was first introduced in January 2021. The model is capable of creating unique and creative images based on a variety of inputs, including animals, objects, and even abstract concepts.

3. Which is stronger, bard or Bing Chat?

Bard and Bing Chat are both chatbot platforms with their own strengths and weaknesses.

Bard is an open source chatbot framework that allows developers to create custom chatbots using various programming languages. It is highly customizable and can be tailored to specific use cases, making it a good choice for businesses or organizations with unique needs.

On the other hand, Bing Chat is a pre-built chatbot platform that integrates with Microsoft Teams. It's designed to be easy to use and can quickly answer common questions or perform simple tasks like scheduling a meeting or finding information.

Ultimately, choosing between Bard and Bing Chat depends on your specific needs and technical expertise. If you have a team of developers who can create custom chatbots, then Bard may be the better choice. If you're looking for a quick and easy way to implement a chatbot, Bing Chat may be the way to go.

## About Bard, share my experience with it.

Google's AI tool, Bard, is a very interesting and useful body of online tools that help users quickly process and organize large amounts of data. Below, I will share my feelings and experience of using Bard.

First of all, Bard is very powerful, it can handle various types of data, including text, images and numerical values, etc. Moreover, it is very easy to operate, and it only needs a few steps to complete the data processing task. For example, I once used Bard to process an Excel sheet containing a large amount of data. Through Bard's online processing function, I was able to quickly organize the data I needed, which greatly saved me time and energy.

In the process of using Bard, I also found that it has some other advantages. For example, Bard's parallel computing feature allowed me to complete a large number of data processing tasks in a short period of time, and its data visualization feature allowed me to understand the data more intuitively. In addition, Bard provides a variety of ways to connect to various data sources, so I can easily connect to various data sources, so that I can easily access the data.

Of course, Bard has some shortcomings. For example, sometimes it has minor bugs in its interface that need to wait for fixes. But overall, these problems do not affect my experience and efficiency in using Bard.
In the process of using Bard, I was also able to use it to process data in various fields. For example, in the field of intelligent customer service, Bard can help me quickly handle customer questions and feedback; in the field of image processing, Bard can help me with image recognition and processing. These application scenarios give me a deeper understanding of Bard's functions and application scope.

In short, Google's AI tool Bard is a very useful body of online tools that help users quickly process and organize large amounts of data. Its strengths include simplicity of operation, power, support for parallel computing and data visualization. Although it also has some minor shortcomings, overall these issues do not affect my experience and efficiency in using Bard. In the future, I expect Bard to continue to optimize its interface and improve its functions to bring more convenience to more users.
