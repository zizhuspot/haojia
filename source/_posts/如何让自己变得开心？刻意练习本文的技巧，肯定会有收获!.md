Therefore, mental health issues have become one of the global concerns. Early identification and treatment of mental illnesses is crucial for both personal recovery and healthy development of society.

## Finally, I would like to share with you an insight about my own approach to happiness:

"Life is like a journey, the most beautiful scenery is on the way, and the most valuable reward is the mood along the way." This quote was like a lightning bolt that deeply touched my deepest thoughts: how can I find happiness in my ordinary life and bring nourishment to my mind?

Recently, I discovered a unique way to make me happy - running in the early morning sunshine. As soon as the first rays of sunlight gently pour through the windows, I put on my workout gear and head out the door to embrace a brand new day. During my morning run, I feel as if I am in a peaceful painting, with fresh air and warm sunshine flowing through me like poetry, making my heart happy. I felt the power of nature and experienced the beauty of life.

Running in the morning not only gifts me a healthy body, but also lets me gain deep insights in every run. Every time, I meet people who are also running in the morning, which makes me deeply feel that we are all striving for a better self. This deep realization makes me more grateful for every gift of life and more appreciative of every present moment.

Of course, running in the morning is not always smooth sailing. Sometimes, I need to overcome my laziness, and sometimes, I slack off because the weather doesn't cooperate. However, I firmly believe that as long as I have enough determination and perseverance, these are not problems. In the coming days, I will be more determined to practice this secret of happiness and make it an important part of my life.

In the journey of life, keeping a happy mind is the most important thing. By running in the morning, I not only get physical exercise, but also gain pleasure in my mind. I believe that as long as we look for it with our hearts and experience it with our minds, we will surely find the source of happiness that suits us. Let's together in the journey of life, appreciate the scenery along the way, enjoy the mood of seeing the scenery.
