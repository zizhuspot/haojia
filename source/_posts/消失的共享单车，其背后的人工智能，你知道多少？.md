In less than three years, bike sharing has become one of the most controversial topics in the city. While bringing convenience to short-distance travel for residents of big cities, the operation and management of the bikes is becoming a huge challenge.

Every day, we can see thousands of shared bicycles. In some places, they are neatly arranged, while in others, you may not see one all day. For the platforms of bike sharing, how to decide where to place the bikes and how many bike sharing bikes to place is a study worth looking into. If the vehicles placed are unattended, then the delivery will be much less effective; and if people can't find the bikes when they need them, then the platform will suffer.

But how can you determine where the bikes should be placed? Once the bikes are ridden to all corners of the city, how can they be dispatched to ensure that more people ride them? The platform receives thousands of pictures of faulty vehicles every day, so how can the real problem be identified from them? These problems can not be solved without the help of artificial intelligence.

Yin Daquan, Chief Data Scientist of Mobike, will share a keynote speech on "How Mobike Uses Artificial Intelligence to Achieve Fine-grained Operation of Bicycles" at the Global Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Technology Conference (AICon), where he will introduce how Mobike uses big data and AI technology to solve problems such as illegal parking and bicycle operation. He will also share his latest explorations on how to deal with tidal phenomenon in operation and optimize scheduling.

Prior to the conference, InfoQ conducted an interview with Daquan Yin to give readers a glimpse of the application of AI on Mobike and a deeper understanding of the technology and strategy behind it. In this interview, Daquan Yin will explain in detail how Mobike uses AI to improve bike utilization, reduce downtime, and enhance the travel experience of users.

## From academia to industry

After earning his PhD, Yin Dajue chose to step into his professional career by completing a post-doctoral fellowship at Tsinghua University. The veteran graduate of Peking University went on to join the industry after years of honing his academic career. Before joining Mobike, he gained experience as a product engineer and senior data engineer for Esri and Dhgate.

For Yin Dajue, the biggest difference in crossing over from academia to industry is speed. Unlike academia, which focuses on theoretical proofs, industry requires a higher degree of timeliness in translating applied results. In his words, "In academia, you can 'sharpen a sword in ten years', but in industry, you need to 'run in small steps'."

After joining Mobike, Yin Dajue started to build Mobike's data team from scratch. He also encountered a lot of challenges in the process. New employees came from all over the world, from seasoned veterans to fledgling newcomers. How to let them quickly integrate into the company's entrepreneurial environment, learn to work as a team, and improve their combat effectiveness was a major challenge for him. His solution is to create more opportunities for collective learning and common growth.

Today, the Mobile Data group has taken shape and includes the Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Business Intelligence Analytics, Visualization Analytics, Data Services and Data Architecture groups. The reports, algorithms and data services provided by this team support all business units such as operations, finance, product, marketing, customer service, government, etc., digitally driving the company's rapid growth.

## Artificial Intelligence Landing Project Mopay

Yin Dashe told us that Mopay configured artificial intelligence technology very early. With the accumulation of certain data, Moto began to selectively use some of the mainstream ai technology for prediction and classification.

At present, mainstream ai technology applications are often applied to image and sound processing, natural language processing, recommender systems, unmanned driving and other fields, but there are not many ai technology applications in the field of bicycle mobility. This is a great challenge for the application of AI technology in the mobile bike sharing business situation. Existing ai technology should be grafted based on the understanding of the automobile field. Yin Dabuchi regarded supply and demand prediction using dnn ideas as "an idea comes from idea process". mobile borrowed a paper on environmental pollution prediction written by Mr. Zheng Yu of Microsoft Research Asia, and used resnet (a variant of dnn) to predict the dispersion of atmospheric pollutants. Since the operation of bike sharing also solves the prediction problem, this paper inspired the mobile data science team to work on lesnet.

## Currently, the main versions of AI in cell phones

(- Deep neural networks to predict the balance between supply and demand to provide a solid foundation for procurement. Using a spatial gridding method, combining the number of vehicles in each grid, historical order data and weather forecast information, the trained deep neural network predicts the measured value at a future moment.

Using image recognition technology to help customer service and improve work efficiency: a bicycle company launched an app that encourages the reporting of violations, allowing users to take photos and upload violations. However, the number of photos received each day was in the thousands, many of which were duplicates, placing a burden on customer service leaders. As a result, Moto will use deep learning technology to determine if bike parking regulations are being violated. Currently, it is difficult for machines to recognize subtle differences in photos, requiring manual assistance for about 1% of photos, while the remaining 99% of photos can be fully recognized by machines, effectively reducing customer service workload).

## Structure and Evolution of the Rubik's Cube Artificial Intelligence Platform

The mobile big data AI platform is also known as "lubic cube". One of the core applications of lubic cube is to accurately predict the supply and demand of shared vehicles throughout the day, and to provide intelligent directions for vehicle input, scheduling, operation and maintenance.

The overall structure of lubic cube refers to the structure of major network companies, based on file repository hadoop, stream computing spark, storm, flink, machine learning model training and prediction of tensorflow.

Mobile's data platform has essentially evolved with the expansion of Mobile's business. All data reporting for mobile was built on relational databases such as mysql, but with the rapid expansion of services, the amount of data increased geometrically and queries were very slow. Mobile's data platform is based on the hadoop ecosystem, which translates into massive data queries via hive/impala. Moto continues to evolve by using kylin in olap, adding spark/storm streaming data analytics for bike condition monitoring and real-time locking control, and introducing tensor flow in online machine learning.

Currently, the input volume prediction and real-time scheduling of "Magic Square" platform is mainly based on vehicle data, past order data, weather and holiday information and other data. Most of this information is obtained through cell phone systems, and the weather information is obtained through open source code. Vehicle information is the basis for mobile forecasting, past orders provide past trends, and weather is the random event that has the greatest impact on orders, and this information is integrated into the model for use as a forecasting variable.
Bike travel data is more than just business data

Currently, Moto has information about the location and movement path of the bike, but also information about the status of Moto's smart locking device, the large number of logs generated by the server, and many other shared data.

## Yin Daliye told us about some examples of data applications outside of operations.

(* The Beijing municipal government recently agreed to build a bicycle highway between Xi'erqi and Zhongguancun. During the planning stage, Moto provided city planners with exclusive trajectory data to inform the location of this road.

When Xiamen City builds its subway, it uses real traffic data as a guide for building new lines, looking for heavily trafficked areas to choose as subway routes. And this mobile bicycle traffic data fulfills this need.
According to an urban planning study jointly conducted by Mobility and the World Bank, the TOD (Transit Oriented Design) theory, which has been advocated for urban construction planning, emphasizes construction within an 800-meter radius centered on a subway hub. In reality, however, bicycles can easily travel 3 to 5 kilometers, thus expanding the accessibility of the traditional TOD theory and making urban construction less reliant on the subway's perimeter. This discovery could have far-reaching implications for future urban construction.

Mobile bicycles have now entered many cities in China and have even ventured overseas. Bike sharing data from different cities and regions has a variety of different characteristics. Yin Daguang also shared an example with us.

The picture above shows the travel patterns of the areas around Shangdi in Beijing and Xicun subway station in Guangzhou on weekdays and weekends. Shangdi is a typical work area where people have very regular travel habits, mainly focused on commuting to and from work. The number of cyclists on weekends is significantly lower. However, the situation in Guangzhou Xicun is completely different. A large number of people choose to ride bicycles on both weekdays and weekends. These characteristics show a significant difference in the economic lifestyles of the two areas.)

## There are a few points I would like to share with you about bike sharing

In the pulse of the city, the shining appearance of shared bikes has undoubtedly brought about a brand new trend of traveling. This handy helper for short-distance travel has gradually become a favorite among citizens by virtue of its green, convenient and practical as well as affordable features.

As a citizen who is keen on sharing bicycles, I am deeply impressed by the travel convenience it brings. In short-distance travel, shared bicycles save us valuable time by skipping the hassle of waiting for and squeezing into a car. At the same time, the popularity of shared bicycles has also significantly reduced urban traffic congestion. What's more, it is worth mentioning that shared bicycles also reduce the emission of automobile exhaust to a certain extent, contributing to green environmental protection.

Of course, the impact of bike-sharing does not stop at the convenience of citizens, but it also provides a new perspective for urban management. First of all, the popularity of shared bicycles has sounded an alarm for us: urban planning should pay more attention to and improve public traveling facilities. Secondly, bike sharing also exposes the inadequacy of urban transportation management. In order to make better use of shared resources, government departments should work closely with bike-sharing companies to develop more reasonable management policies.

Looking to the future, we need to think from multiple perspectives in order to let bike-sharing play a more important role. First, from the perspective of urban transportation, bike sharing can be an important supplement to the public transportation system. By optimizing the distribution and management of shared bicycles, the carrying pressure of large public transport facilities such as subways and buses can be reduced. Secondly, from the perspective of green environmental protection, encouraging the public to use shared bicycles can reduce fuel consumption, thereby reducing carbon emissions and further promoting the vigorous development of green travel. Finally, from the perspective of social responsibility, bike-sharing companies have an obligation to ensure the sustainability of their operations. Not only should they pursue economic benefits, but also pay attention to social benefits and actively fulfill their social responsibilities.

All in all, bike sharing has injected positive energy into city life with its unique advantages. I firmly believe that as long as we can reasonably plan and manage shared resources, shared bicycles will play a more important role in future urban transportation. At the same time, I also call on government departments and enterprises to work together to regulate and guide the development and growth of shared bicycles, so that they can truly become a brand new choice for urban travel.
