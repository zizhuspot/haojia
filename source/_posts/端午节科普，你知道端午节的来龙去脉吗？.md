The Chinese Dragon Boat Festival, also known as the "Dragon Boat Festival", carries a rich historical and cultural tradition whose origins can be traced back to China more than 2,000 years ago. The festival is celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar, and usually takes place in June.

The Dragon Boat Festival honors the memory of an outstanding ancient Chinese poet and statesman, Qu Yuan. Known for his deep love and loyalty to his country, Qu Yuan expressed his deep protest by throwing himself into the river when his country was in turmoil.

To prevent fish and evil spirits from devouring Qu Yuan's remains, people threw packages known as zongzi into the river, while banging gongs and drums and rowing small boats to drive away demons and spirits. This tradition gradually evolved into the Dragon Boat Festival we celebrate today.

During the festival, dragon boat racing became the most popular activity. Dragon boat races are held in rivers and lakes, with teams paddling to the rhythm of drums. Dragon boats are long and narrow, decorated with a mighty dragon's head and tail, and it is believed that the spirit of the dragon can bring good luck and drive away evil.

In addition to dragon boat racing, people hang bags of herbs called "artemisia" and wear clothes made of colorful silk threads to ward off evil spirits. In addition, tasting zongzi (rice dumplings), drinking xionghuang wine and participating in various cultural activities are also important ways to celebrate this festival.

Overall, the Dragon Boat Festival is not only a traditional sporting event, but also a unique way to commemorate history and honor Qu Yuan and Chinese culture.

In the 29th year of the Qianlong reign (1736) of the Qing Dynasty, dragon boat races began to be held in Taiwan. At that time, Taiwan's governor, Chiang Yuan-jun, hosted a friendly race at the Half Moon Pond of Fahua Temple in Tainan City. Nowadays, dragon boat races are held in Taiwan every year on May 5th. In Hong Kong, races are also held.

In addition, rowing dragon boat has been introduced to neighboring countries such as Japan, Vietnam and the United Kingdom. 1980, dragon boat racing was included in China's national sports competitions, and held annually "Qu Yuan Cup" Dragon Boat Race. 1991 June 16 (the fifth day of the fifth month according to the Chinese lunar calendar), in the second hometown of Qu Yuan in China's Hunan city of Yueyang, held the first International Dragon Boat Festival. Prior to the race, the "Dragon Head Festival" was held, which preserved traditional rituals and injected new modern elements. The "dragon head" was carried into the Qu Zi Ancestral Hall, where the athletes "reddened" the dragon head (draped with a red sash), the officiating priest read out the sacrificial text, and the dragon head was "enlightened" (i.e., lighted). Then, participate in the sacrifice of the dragon's three bows, the dragon is carried to the Buro River, running to the Dragon Boat Race. More than 600,000 people participated in the race, fair and celebration, which was an unprecedented event. Since then, Hunan has regularly organized the International Dragon Boat Festival.

Today, dragon boat racing has become a way of honoring tradition, promoting Chinese culture, fostering teamwork and strengthening the body. People of all ages and backgrounds from all over the world enjoy this activity!

Rice dumplings are an integral part of the celebratory protagonist of the Dragon Boat Festival, a traditional custom said to have originated from the legend of Qu Yuan. Qu Yuan, an outstanding Chinese statesman and writer, touched people's hearts with his loyalty to his country and his desire for peace.

Legend has it that Qu Yuan did his best to assist the King of Chu during a time of war and political turmoil. However, when his kingdom was conquered by an enemy country, he was exiled and finally chose to throw himself into the river with a broken heart. To prevent fish and other creatures from devouring his remains, people threw zongzi (粽子), a special food made of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo leaves and filled with various fillings, into the river.

As time passed, the tradition evolved into a way of honoring and respecting Qu Yuan. Every Dragon Boat Festival, people make zongzi and race dragon boats as a way to remember history and Qu Yuan's sacrifice. These zongzi not only represent our reverence for the past, but also a hope for peace in the future.

Today's dumplings are no longer just traditional food, they are a cultural symbol. Whether you are a fan of sweet dumplings, a lover of salty dumplings, or a vegetarian, you can find your own flavor in dumplings. Each of these dumplings with different flavors tells a different story, and they allow us to learn about a variety of regional cultures and traditions while savoring the food.

As for what the dumplings look like, it's an even more colorful world! From sweet to salty, from big to small, from south to north, each kind of zongzi has its own unique image and taste. For example, Guangdong's zongzi like to be filled with seafood, while Shanghai's zongzi tend to be small and delicate, with fresh meat and salted egg yolks as fillings. There are also vegetarian dumplings with local specialties, such as tofu and mushrooms as fillings.

All in all, zongzi is not only a delicacy, but also a carrier of culture. Let us taste the dumplings at the same time, but also to feel the deep cultural heritage and the great patriotic feelings of Qu Yuan it!
