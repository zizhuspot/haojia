We will have a localized effect explanation

## *How are feathers colored? *

Feather itself is not a specific modeling, can not directly strip UV drawing mapping, you need to combine Yeti, Arnold some attributes and nodes, plus color mapping in order to present a lifelike feather effect.

## Feather coloring - converting feather properties to simulate hairs

Create attribute node to customize feather UV

After customizing the UV of the feather, shift the feather by 0.5 on the X-axis, this red box is a UV grid and the purple box inside is the UV range of the feather.

Import the texture into the material, and assign the customized U and V coordinates to the texture coordinates.

This way the feather pattern will be very regular and will not stretch or be affected by changes in the shape of the feather.

There are multiple color variations of the feathers on the body, and in the same outline, you can call the switch node attribute to record multiple different colors.

Inherit the properties created in Groom to instance

Substituting properties into the Switch node calls the material

## **Summary of the production program

Production of feathers in addition to mastering the above node usage in addition to analyze the production of birds Yeti node outline and the allocation of Groom, with the material can be made in different colors and forms of feathers change.

## Extended information

### 1.* What is UV?

"UV" is short for U and V texture mapping coordinates, which are like the X, Y, and Z axes of a spatial model, defining the positional information of each point on the image. uv maps each point on the image accurately to the surface of the modeled object, in the same way that each point on a map corresponds exactly to each location on the earth. At the locations of the gaps between points, the software performs a smooth interpolation of the image, which is called UV mapping.

UV focuses on polygons and subdividing an element of the surface, just as locating a planet in a sea of stars. At the same time, it is the coordinate point that determines the 2D texture, through which the texture's correspondence on the model is controlled. The texture here is primarily a 2D texture, as is the precise placement of a piece of wallpaper on a wall. Each UV on the model is directly dependent on each vertex on the model, in the same way that each star is assigned a unique name. Pixel points located in a particular UV will be placed on top of the vertex that this UV is attached to on the model, just like assigning a unique orbit to each star.

The importance of UV editing cannot be overstated, like an explorer searching for treasure on an unknown map. In order to get a very good UW mapping on a polygonal model, we have to adjust the UVs of the Polygons model several times. Both file textures and program textures are determined by UV coordinates, and a good or bad UV distribution will have a direct impact on the final mapping, just as important as marking the location of the treasure on a map.

### 2.* Advantages of using UV in real life? *

Printed materials injected with the source of life, three-dimensional and silky touch all in one, the beauty of the upgrade at your fingertips.

Brightness doubled, the protective layer of body protection, so that the prints are everlasting, corrosion resistance, friction resistance, goodbye to the trouble of scratches.

With the traditional four-color process printing than one to one, Yinan Printing Printing is confident that the amount of UV printing ink is better.

Laminating printing to the UV process, the safety factor rises linearly, and environmental requirements are easily met.

## 10 years of special effects designer, for the younger generation of experience sharing:

![](https://s2.loli.net/2023/09/23/BmDCuyNA8KHZEag.png)

As a special effects designer with ten years of practical experience, I am deeply happy to share my experience and insights to the juniors who are on their way. Special effects design, a field full of no possible way, is like a world full of magic and imagination, which spurs us to keep learning and exploring, just to pursue the unparalleled visual impact. Next, I will share with you some of my discoveries and experiences in this marvelous field.

First of all, just like an explorer searching for a mysterious treasure, learning VFX design requires us to master those powerful software tools; Adobe After Effects, Cinema 4D and Blender, etc. These names are like magic incantations that turn your imagination into reality. For beginners, start with basic video editing and compositing skills and gradually master the magic of these software. At the same time, some knowledge of photography, videography, and fine arts will help you better understand the mysteries and expressions of special effects design.

Special effects designers are like magicians, constantly accumulating and improving their magic skills. It requires us to constantly observe, study and practice to open the door of our imagination. Watching great movie and TV productions, studying the portfolios and blogs of special effects designers, and learning about the latest special effects techniques and trends are like searching for clues to magic, allowing you and I to find our way to becoming better special effects designers. At the same time, make some special effects works by yourself, and through repeated practice and summarization, you will find that your magic skills continue to improve.

There are a few things we need to pay special attention to in the process of creating special effects. First of all, special effects need to be harmonized with the rhythm and style of the whole film, and should not spoil the audience's visual enjoyment. Secondly, we need to consider factors such as the brightness, color and contrast of the screen to make the special effects look more realistic and natural. Furthermore, we need to pay attention to the size of the file and the rendering time to avoid any trouble caused by improper handling. Finally, we have to make the special effects match with the actors' performances and the music tempo to make the movie reach perfection.

In conclusion, I would like to say that my journey of special effects design is not a smooth one, but I always believe that only through continuous learning, accumulation and experimentation, we can find our own magic path. I hope my sharing can help you go farther and higher on the path of special effects design. Let's be the one who manipulates the magic together and create our own visual wonders!
