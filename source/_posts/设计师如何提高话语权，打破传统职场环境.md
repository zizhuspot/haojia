- "This design doesn't rock enough!"

- "Don't worry about the details, users won't notice."

- "In this case, the interaction workload will be very large ah, but the actual enhancement is not much"

I believe that the above words are commonplace in the workplace, right, in the process of project implementation, because of the above sentence, the original efforts to design overthrow and redo, stay up late and work overtime but cancel the work of the difficult scene we all feel.

Then this article will provide you with some suggestions that can help you in the workplace with the development of the relationship between the partner more objective, to improve your satisfaction with the work in the heart of the party and the boss, your satisfaction with the work of pixel-level restoration and presentation!

## The Designer's Dilemma, Why are designers more vulnerable in the workplace environment?

In my opinion, there are two reasons:

One is that people think that design is more of an execution job, and that "passively" receiving demands is enough;

The second is related to the designers' own unclear design goals.

Visual presentation, user experience, and business benefits are regarded as the three main goals of design.

The first point is easy to understand, so I won't repeat it. Let's talk about the second point: !

Some designers take visual presentation as the design goal, focusing on whether the interface is beautiful, interface dynamics, icon refinement and other details, while some designers take user experience as the highest goal of design, focusing on whether the user's operation is smooth. Smooth.

While it is right to focus on visual presentation and user experience in the design process, the purpose of commercial design is to make a profit. Whether you are designing a poster or a logo, commercial interest must be the most important point.

Therefore, when sorting out the design ideas, you must consider the two main factors of product goals and business goals, so you, like a product manager, must start from the needs, understand the needs, users, and scenarios in order to prescribe the right program. Medicine and design the right content.

Design thinking becomes clear when business goals are aligned with the product manager or boss!

So how do you improve a designer's voice?

## How can designers improve their voice?

**1) Participate in the front, strive for full voice **

Many designers like to bury their heads in the sand, complain occasionally, and work hard, but this work habit also prevents their words from being heard by key decision makers.
When it comes to the actual work, designers should put themselves in the front as much as possible, taking on the requirements and outputting the design, rather than becoming part of the project workflow.

Active participation in the pre-product requirements discussion, requirements review and planning will not only give you a clear understanding of the background and logic of the project business, but also help you plan the subsequent work content design and testing.

On the premise of attending the meeting, you should also get a full voice for yourself. Voice your opinions, participate in discussions with project-related colleagues, and gradually raise your voice.

**2) Empathy + professional expression**

Having taken the first step, you already have the ability to actively participate in the preliminary work. Next, how to properly communicate and express yourself in a way that is more acceptable to the participants? My view is empathy and professional expression.

Put yourself in the participants' shoes, consider whether your solution meets the needs of the business and users, and seek a win-win situation without conflicting with your own work.

## Summary

I hope the above suggestions can help you navigate your way through the workplace like a fish in water! At the same time, it's important to study in-depth the application of AI design tools in real life, and accurately seize the opportunities of the times, so that you can grow and advance yourself even more.

Here are a few tips for designers to enhance their professionalism:

Knowledge reserve competition: actively learn and draw on design theories and design principles, track design trends, as well as understand the latest industry news and development trends, so as to enhance your own design literacy and professional knowledge.

Let's diversify: Try to get in touch with different types of design projects, such as graphic design, product design, user interface/user experience design, etc., and exercise your design ability and creativity through diversified design projects.

Designer's social circle: Actively participate in the design community and industry events, communicate and share experiences with other designers, which will bring you endless inspiration and feedback, and help you continuously improve your design level.

Practice makes perfect: Keep practicing to improve your design skills and expression, and optimize your portfolio to showcase your design strengths.

Accept challenges: Accept criticism and feedback from others, find out your weaknesses, and then work hard to improve and enhance them.

In a nutshell, designers need to keep learning, practicing and communicating with others in order to continuously improve their professional level. In addition, the application of artificial intelligence in real life is very extensive and has covered various fields, bringing a lot of convenience and innovation to our lives.

## 15 years of designers' experience in the workplace, I hope it will be helpful to newcomers:

Explore the design journey: the depth and breadth of 15 years of workplace experience

I, a battle-hardened design warrior, have 15 years of combat experience in the workplace. I have gradually grown from a novice to a senior designer in this challenging and competitive field. Today, I would like to share with you my design path and the valuable experiences and lessons I have gained along the way.

I am a veteran of the visual communication design program, and I have gradually built up my design arsenal through self-study of diverse knowledge systems such as graphic design, UI design and user experience design. My professional skills include, but are not limited to, the flexible use of design software such as Adobe Creative Suite, Sketch, Figma, etc., and even the writing of front-end code such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In these 15 years, I have worked as a designer in several well-known Internet companies and startups, polishing and improving my abilities from practice.

This 15-year journey in the workplace is both an epic of growth and a history of struggling with difficulties and challenges. From the youthfulness and ignorance of a novice designer to the calmness and sophistication of a senior designer, I have experienced a lot of ups and downs in this process. When I first entered the job market, I used to hit the wall everywhere because of my lack of practical experience. However, it was these setbacks and difficulties that made me understand my own shortcomings and gave me the motivation to move forward.

In my career as a designer, I deeply feel the importance of good communication skills. In my work, I have to work closely with product managers, developers, testers and many other parties. Only through effective communication can we understand our respective needs and reach a consensus. Secondly, problem-solving skills play a pivotal role in a designer's work. Designers need to solve a variety of complex problems within a limited time, such as how to balance user experience and business objectives, how to follow the brand norms for innovation and so on. Finally, continuous learning and experimentation are the driving forces behind a designer's progress. In this ever-changing industry, designers need to keep an eye on the industry and technology trends, and be willing to try new design methods and tools.

Looking back on the past 15 years, I am proud of what I have achieved. I have successfully designed brand images and website interfaces for many well-known Internet companies, as well as provided many targeted design solutions for startups. However, I also understand my shortcomings in the workplace, for example, I still need to improve my skills in leading teams and managing projects.

In conclusion, these 15 years of workplace experience have made me deeply realize the importance of continuous learning and progress as a designer. I will continue to actively improve my design skills, accumulate more workplace wisdom, and bring more value to the company and the team. Finally, I would like to give some advice to my juniors: keep your passion and curiosity for design, and be brave to try new techniques and methods; work hard to improve your communication skills and teamwork ability; pay close attention to the industry to understand the market demand and trends; and most importantly, keep learning and growing to create more opportunities and value for yourself.
