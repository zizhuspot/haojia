## Who am I?

Hi, I'm jiahao. i'm a visual design practitioner and love visual design and movie special effects. I am here to share my experience and insights, and hope to communicate and learn from more people.

## My Experience

I have a lot of experience in post-production and movie special effects. During this time I have learned a lot and encountered many challenges. But it is these experiences that have allowed me to grow and shape my personality and values.
